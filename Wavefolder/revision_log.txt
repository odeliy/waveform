rev 0
- initial draft created

rev 1
- redo pcb routing
- remove R22, the 510R resistor in feedback loop of final fold opamp.
  I kinda monkey-see-monkey-do'd that resistor into the schem. It's
  not on the original Serge schematic. Maybe it was put there for
  current limiting, but that isn't needed. I don't think it serves
  a real purpose so it's gone!
- added C14 for stability just to be safe

rev 2
- remove normalled connections
- no tht parts

v1.3
- added trimmer for VCA "bridge", nulls cv bleedthrough
- replaced discrete Q1 & Q2 w/ monolithic pair
- changed to PJ301BM Jacks
- removed 20K resistor from RV2 to ground. 20K was too big and folded some signals even when fold was minimized. Removing it all together will add full cut capability and allow for any sized input signal to be used.
